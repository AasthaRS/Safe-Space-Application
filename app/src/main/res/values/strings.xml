    <string name="des">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:</string>
   <string name="line1">
       1. Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
   </string>
    <string name="line2">
       2. Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
   </string>
    <string name="line3">
       3. Family history of mental health problems
   </string>
    <string name="lastline">Mental health problems are common but help is available. </string>

    <string name="m2header">Myth: Children do not experience mental health problems.</string>
    <string name="m2content">Fact: Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns. These mental health problems are often clinically diagnosable, and can be a product of the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors.

        Half of all mental health disorders show first signs before a person turns 14 years old, and three quarters of mental health disorders begin before age 24.

    <string name="m3header">Myth: People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable.</string>
    <string name="m3content">Fact: The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent than anyone else. Most people with mental illness are not violent and only 3%â€“5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness.

Employers who hire people with mental health problems report good attendance and punctuality as well as motivation, good work, and job tenure on par with or greater than other employees.</string>

<string name="m9header">Myth: Prevention does not work. It is impossible to prevent mental illnesses.</string>
